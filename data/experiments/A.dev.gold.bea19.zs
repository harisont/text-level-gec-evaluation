It's difficult to answer the question "what are you going to do in the future?" if the only one who has to know it is in two minds.
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher, a saleswoman, and even a butcher. I don't know why.
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people.
It's difficult because I'll have to study hard and a lot, but I think that if you like a subject, you'll find it easier to study.
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe I won 't .
I think that public transport will always be in the future.
The rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use public transport.
I consider driving a car more convenient because you can carry more things in your own car than by travelling by car.
Also, you'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something to be friends and change your telephone number.
In my experience, when I didn't have a car, I used the bus to go to school and back to my house.
In my opinion, the car isn't necessary when you have crashed in the street; in that moment you realized the importance of public transport.
In India we have various types of Public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Car , Train & Flight .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place, the mode of transport is chosen accordingly.
But, generally speaking, travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport.
This reminds me of a recent trip I took to Agra.
It takes around 6 hours to go from Delhi to Agra by National highway.
We have stopped at hotels for food and in case any of us feels hungry, we have purchased some snacks before the trip.
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & Flight ) .
In addition to it, we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh.
Because of the reasons mentioned above, I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient.
My name is Sarah.
I am 17 years old.
I am looking forward to joining you in this year's summer camps.
I love children and enjoy looking after them. Also, I organized many sports activities before in my school.
In addition to that, I enjoy cooking.
My family thinks that my cook is amazing.
I hope that you give me the chance to join you.
Thank you
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends.
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere, when I travel to the beach I like playing with my sister in the sand and after we go to the sea.
It is very funny.
When I was young, I liked playing with the ball in the playground, and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a net for volleyball.
Dear Jo,
How are you? I'm writing to give you some advice on travelling and working in my country.
On the one hand, there are a lot of places to travel in my country.
For example, Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia.
There are wonderful cities, for example Madrid, where you can visit places like "Puerta del Sol" and "Las Cibeles".
I visit Madrid twice a year.
I suggest that you visit Sevilla because I love this city.
On the other hand, in my country there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad.
But if you want, I will look for a job from you.
My best friend is looking for someone responsible for looking after her sister.
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend.
Will you be interested in this job?
Thank you for your e-mail, it was wonderful to hear from you.
I look forward to seeing you.
Take care, Laura.
Today public transport still plays an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future.
Public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system.
Also, people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car.
But it can use a cheaper way to get to their destination especially if it is far away from home.
For example, I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for travelling to another country.
Instead, it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane.
In my opinion, I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that don't have enough money to pay for a car, even if it is used. So public transport will continue to have a future, but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground.
If we think about it, the car is better because we don't need to wait for them as we are waiting for the bus or underground, but in another way, car costs more money than the public transport.
By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport.
If I had to choose between both transportation, I think I would probably choose car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus.
In my community, we are very interested in environment and ecological things.
We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden, with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school.
In some strategic points of the building we have special trashcans to separate the garbage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles and they also made talks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc.
Miss June Sid is the manager of this project.
All these initiatives have made us a recognised ecological community over the years.
Good morning everyone, today I want to share about my favorite sport.
My favorite sport is football because it is an international sport that people around the world love. For example, the Barclay Premier League, Liga Premier, and Fifa World Cup are all popular football competitions.
I believe that's all that will delight us.
By the way, my favorite football team is Manchester United. They are brilliant, they have amazing football players, and they are awesome.
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was to be a super hero!
After many years he still dreams to become a super hero.
He entered the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession was more similar to being a super hero.
He passed some years of the university and he knew a girl called Kate and he got loved on here and she got loved in him.
Kate was cursing the fashion university.
Then the two started dating.
Michael and Kate were so happy, until one day when Michael said his dream was to be a super hero, Kate got so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid's dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super heroes don't exist.
When she said that, Michael started to cry and get mad, saying that she was lying and didn't have a heart.
He got so mad that he asked her to leave his apartment.
The next day, she said sorry and they were happy again.
But when they get to the home of Michael they fight again and Michael gets a knife and kills her.
He cried with a lot of blood around.
Michael, get away from there.
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.
Public transportation is an important invention in human history. It brings a lot of benefits in our life.
For instance, we take the subway to avoid stocking in traffic.
Although it is more convenient to move by car than take public transportation, it would cause more damage to our life and harm our environment.
Therefore, we need to think more about our future and our offspring.
Giving them a safe, clean, and comfortable place to live.
If there is no public transportation, traffic jams will be more serious than before.
In my country, Taipei, we always get stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning.
I cannot imagine if there is no bus or MRT, how long I will take for school.
Cars are convenient for humans, but they also bring damage to humans.
For example, carbon dioxide is created by cars.
It causes global warming which threatens our environment and harms our daily life.
we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disasters that have happened in decades, such as typhoons, hurricanes, wild fires, and mud slides.
What other precautions are usually taken?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film has shipped.
If the film doesn't arrive on time, it will be canceled immediately.
Lost shipments will be found more easily when this process is started right away.
The pleasure of traveling is that you get to see new places.
People go, people come.
What's the best way to do international travel?
The most important option to travel, by far, is the plane.
But, even when it's true that it's the faster option, you must be very careful at times to get off a plane.
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation, obviously you have to take a boat.
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy on the trip.
Although picking out a train is the better option.
There is no comparison between watching the changes in the landscape through a window and enjoying the way that you are doing it . The best part is that it is the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway, no matter how you go, no matter where you go.
The pleasure of travelling is travelling at all.
Transportation is one of the most important things in life, so we have many kinds of transportation now. We travel by car, but in the near future there will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like a fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than an hour. This will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of time and effort, so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible.
In modern societies, there are lots of friends around us in our daily lives.
Big project could not be finished without co-operations.
Friends could communicate and exchange ideas, feelings, and funny things that happen to us.
More importantly, the parents give us life and they touch us with knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world.
In this case, the families played important roles in each other's daily lives.
The reasons are as follows:
First of all, we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience.
For example, we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way, and we could also learn how to make a meal from our parents.
Secondly, the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble.
If difficulties were told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation.
In this case, the families are the most important friends in our lives.
Computing technology has advanced a great deal in recent years, making old computers almost obsolete and widening the gap between old and new computers with every new discovery.
As we can notice, old and new computers are vastly different, starting from the size of the computers. Old computers were much bigger than new computers.
Old computers used to occupy one entire room, now they only have the size of a box, or even the size of a book.
You can have a portable computer now, and take it with you to every place you visit.
Old computers only let you do math tasks or play simple games with 2 colors (green and black), but now you can do whatever you want to do, like creating or playing videogames, writing or reading a book, connecting to the internet, watching or making videos, inventing new stuff to improve the Computing Technology, and not only in 2 colors, but thousands of them.
One of the greatest achievements of new computing is the internet, where you can connect to other computers, download stuff, etc. via Ethernet cable or wireless connection (Wi-Fi).
You got owned mate
I went to the abandoned house and started to think of the best way to make his life miserable. I passed the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him suffer.
I didn't find anything, so I went to the place he lives and started looking for information about his life. I found people he cares about, and as I continued going to his house, I noticed he always goes to the same house. So I decided to follow him to the house and found out he was dating a girl. She might be his girlfriend, so I finally got an idea: I would drive him crazy, just as he did with me. That way, she would think he had problems on his mind and would leave him. But then I thought about it again and realized that if I did that, she would try to help him and they would be more united. So I decided to drive them both crazy, almost to the point of death, just as he did with me.
But wait a minute, am I really so angry to make this?
Yes!
I screamed. My anger had dominated my mind. I didn't have any control over my actions. I was afraid of what I had become and what I could do, but I couldn't control myself. The only thing I could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisfaction I would feel when I finally had my revenge, the best revenge.
But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and bigger, I had made a decision I was going to do it, if he dedicated 4 years of his life torturing me and not wanting me to be happy I would the time is necessary for him to have a miserable life and I won't stop until I had accomplished my goal.
I don't agree with this idea completely.
On the one hand, traveling by car is really much more convenient as it gives you the chance to be independent.
On the other hand, huge traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car.
My favorite sport.
I was born to be a football player.
Football is everything in my life.
When I see football on the television, I dream of playing in a big team and in a big championship like the Barclays Premier League, Ligue 1 or Liga BBVA.
My favourite clubs are Benfica and Real Madrid. I think Ronaldo is the best player in the world, which is why he won the Golden Ball in 2014.
I play football in a Portuguese club called valenciano and we won a lot of games this season.
I dream of winning a lot of leagues in Football and winning the best championship, the Uefa Champions League and the best scorer of all time in Uefa Champions League is Cristiano Ronaldo, my favourite player.
I play football because I like it, but the only reason that I do it hardly is because of my dad.
His dream is that I become the next captain of a big team and win a lot of money.
My name is Jonny.
I graduated from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.
I am twenty-five years old.
I am interested in looking after children and playing with children.
I like personality with childlike qualities, so I like children.

I planned many interesting activities to make the competition more exciting.
They enjoyed the game.
I also like cooking.
If my mom cooks, I always help her.
My personality is cheerful, energetic, and hardworking.
I always smile to people.

I am passionate about this job.
If you think I am the right person you want, please give me a response, Thanks.
Public transportation has been used more by people over the years and it is becoming cheaper and more safe, but some people prefer cars. To what extent do we agree with this, and what are our reasons for that? That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay.
Before about 40 years ago, there was no such thing as public transportation and people rarely owned cars. So in those years, there was not even a good way to move from one place to another. That is because there were no companies to build cars. In about 10 years, car trading became viable and also became very supported by having its own fans. At the beginning, it faced a lot of problems but was able to solve them by the end.
Nowadays, all forms of transportation are more convenient, from cars to buses, even trains and planes. Some people prefer cars because they don't like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper, but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster. However, when it comes to traveling a lot, many people prefer to ride in their own cars so they can feel the real experience and enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places.
It is different from one person's opinion to another, but I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more. Eventually, cars will disappear and will no longer be used.
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country.
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture, the scenario has drastically changed in past 10 years.
The development of the biodiesel industry can contribute to productivity growth.
A large scale of investment was brought for biofuel development.
Meanwhile, it boosts economic growth and jobs opportunity, thereby enhancing Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
If you are living in a big town or small town, it does matter, but one thing that should be taken care of by the people and organizers of the town is the environment.
Global warming is a huge issue today.
The government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down.
However, we the people have a really important part in making it worse.
A good government understands the value of taking care of trees, water, air, and much more to provide a fresh, clean, and safe environment to its people.
Recycling items can be a good step to start with a clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city.
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government.
People are not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere.
Eventually, humans will have no more fresh air to breathe.
Additionally, our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and for those under 18, and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean, safe, fresh environment to the city.
In conclusion, I would suggest that our neighbouring cities take part in cleaning the environment so that one day it can be seen throughout the country.
Everybody has their favourite sport.
My favourite sport is football.
I spend a lot of time every day on our school or village football stadium.
I usually play football with my classmates.
Before training, I ran 1-2 kilometers and my legs got power and my body got energy.
Our team has a hard-working coach and he gives professional advice to us on how to improve football skills.
His main words: "You must work and work very hard if you want to get high results."
I can say that the coach is an experienced person.
Not so long ago, we had competition.
The first place was getting by us.
We have achieved this result because we are friendly and organised.
I believe that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatar or Dynamo.
Football is my life.
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport: "You must believe in yourself."
Hello my friend,
What is up?
How are you?
How was your day today?
It was really nice of you to e-mail me yesterday.
You regret that you weren't there with me. I'll try to describe everything precisely, because I know that you are very
Dear Paul,
I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I am quite interested. I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it.
I was born in the UK so I can be a very good teacher of English.
Although I came to Spain ten years later, I can speak with them in Spanish if it is necessary.
Also, I attended a ballet course for 4 years when I was young.
It was a long time ago, but I still have the rhythm in my body!
By the way, I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet course members. I had to be the teacher for one day and I didn't forget it because I felt wonderful.
All members congratulated me as well.
On the other hand, I had taken care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young.
You must know that I am a very responsible, kind and funny person.
That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job, or the hobby for me!
I hope you keep in mind my candidacy because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes, Julia.
In my opinion, the shortage in demand won't affect public transport.
Not everyone can afford to buy their own car.
Besides, there are lots of low income people who can't buy their own car.
So I think public transport's future is bright.
What is the meaning of " Family "?
In my opinion, family is the place where your best friend can help you and know you.
In Taiwan, many people have to take care of their parents when they get old, but the point is what if you can't survive, I mean you don't have enough money to raise your parents.
Back to the topic, I don't know any of the members of my family well, I don't trust them, honestly.
I like New Zealand because there are many islands.
By the way, New Zealand has a cool weather.
In Malaysia, the weather is slightly warmer than it is there.
That's why I order all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a try their own food.
You can also buy a lot of gifts like key chains, statues, or what else memories to be made before returning to Malaysia.
I did not have to go to New Zealand, but believe me it is a very beautiful place.
If I have sustenance, I will go there and bring all of you.
I live in Lentini, a small city in eastern Sicily.
The local Council doesn't have a project for the environment.
People collect any kind of rubbish and throw it all together in a black sack.
Although the Council began to plan something, the people aren't committed to the problem.
Around the city, you can find many places where the people throw away fridges, kitchens, "amianto", old things or furniture.
What a shame !
The suburbs of Lentini could be wonderful.
There are orange trees, a large lake, and Etna in the background.
When I was a child, I had a lot of friends and they were very important to me.
We ever played in the park or we talked about our tastes, music, boys, we laugh a lot of.
But when I was a teenager I began to live in situations that I did not like, for instance, the girls said bad things to me or talked bad about me.
In those years I lived through the worst moments of my life.
I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday, only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party; I think that this day was one of the worst days of my life.
There was one night I cried because I felt that I had no friends.
However, my parents tried to make my party the best and they prepared a special birthday for me. They invited all my cousins and we went to eat pizza together. They gave me a lot of presents.
In that moment, I thought that my best friends were my parents and sister.
I knew that they never talked bad about me.
Now, my husband is my best friend.
He is the most important person in my life.
He has always been with me.
Also, he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him.
Both like to travel around the world and practise some sports, for example, tennis, running or trekking.
We like watching TV series and cooking several desserts as well.
To sum up, my best friends are my family, especially David, my husband.
The lives of people around the globe are becoming busier and busier day by day.
A busy life always compells one to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation system lag behind motor cars .
Hi USA Summer Camps,
This advertisement for a job has been read by a suitable person.
My name is María, and I am from Spain.
I am interested in this work because I enjoy travelling and I am a teacher so I like working with the children.
I am sure that I will take care of children very well.
I would like to speak English perfectly so I think up the idea about if I work in summer camps , I will improve my level of English .
On the other hand, I could teach Spanish to the children in the summer camps.
I am waiting for your answer.
Hi, Sam.
How are you? Are you still living in Madrid?
Yes, I started my lessons last month and it's very interesting.
I'm learning a lot and the students are very friendly.
But I need to study harder because I want to pass the exam , and it 's very difficult .
However, if I carry on studying like now, I will do it.
The lessons are very funny.
Dear Sir or Madam,
I have seen your announcement in the newspaper and I am interested in applying for it.
I can speak English and I am a lovely, energetic, and hardworking person. Besides, I have recommended paper from
my former company.

Besides, I have cooking skills and I love to cook.
I hope you are interested in my application.

Sandra Barrientos is a journalist.
The technology has changed people's lives very much. In fact, we can think about how different our lives are compared to our parents' or grandparents' lives. For example, my parents didn't watch TV because there wasn't any TV in the world when they were young. But this is not the only difference: we can think about the mobile phone, the computer, and at least the internet. Our grandparents couldn't imagine a strange machine like a computer in their lives.
Although the fact that personal vehicles like cars are now popular, in the future, the stance of public transport is still very crucial.
Nowadays, people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling, manufacturing. This source of energy doesn't always maintain at the constant level, but someday it will be run out.
People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity, wind power, and public transportation such as electric metro to use this kind of energy.
As a result, governments will invest more in researching the usage of these new types of energy, and travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car.
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas, making it much more convenient.
Commuting, travelling using public services, will be the first prior choice.
In addition, the population is increasing rapidly. In the near future, almost cities in the world will become overcrowded. It will lead to many other problems to be solved, for example, traffic jams, air pollution.
From some perspectives, these problems are led by the overuse of personal vehicles.
People will realize that using their own car is just a waste of time due to traffic jams or gradually killing themselves by breathing polluted air.
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation.
Each person should practice saving when using any source of energy to protect his own life.
In conclusion, investments in developing public transport will be increased considerably, public services of travelling have a bright potential and it 's stance in the future can't be replaced.
Hello, Alex. How are you?
Are you free for the weekend? Do you have any plans?
My friends and I go to the cinema, and I invite you to go with us.
If you are interested, find me at 8 o'clock near the cinema entrance.
Thank you, Helen, for those wonderful presents.
I always want to read books like this.
I went to the temple in the morning, followed by lunch at the hotel later in the evening. I went to the beach.
In conclusion, it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability, migrants travel for better education prospects and a stable environment for the younger generation to grow up.
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs and economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy.
The cause of brain drain should be tackled at an international and national level on a broader dimension and rational pattern, for it is a global issue.
In this situation, developing nations should take control of inflation; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and law enforcement to support public in a positive manner.
There is enough oxygen at the top of Everest to breathe easily.
Jordan Romero was 13 when he climbed Everest in May 2010.
It is very difficult to climb Mount Everest because it is so high.
The top was reached for the first time by two climbers in 1953.
My friends and I like TV programs, electronic music, and fashionable clothes. I prefer all of them.
Sometimes we go to parties in the city, and I dance with my friends at those parties.
They listen to the music and we are singing.
It is very good.
Jason is my friend. He is drunk and also he danced with your girlfriend.
Jose is the best singer . he is singing and talking in the party .
The other person is Angel, he doesn't dance in all places.
He prefers to study at your home.
Hello, something.
My name is Steven and I'm 14 years old. I'm living in Germany.
In the moment I visit the secondary modern school.
I am in grade 8.
My life is difficult because I have to realize everything.
For example, there is a girl in my class who is beautiful.
I love her look.
Her eyes look like the sun.
But she ignores me.
I hope I can forget her.
Run for your life!
My favourite sport is running.
I like running so fast that it feels as if I'm running on air and my feet hardly touch the ground between strides.
My favourite place to run is in the forest but I like to run in races too.
I like to feel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city of the streets.
The best advice I can give to someone who is starting to run is to start slowly and not to try to run too fast but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little more and a little faster and then after a few years you will be a champion maybe.
In my opinion, television can be educational, whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One.
Of course, it's important to choose the right television show.
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it will hardly have any educational value .
Although one could argue that you can always learn something, this does not mean that you should never stop learning.
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apocalypse should happen, he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead for some time now - so in his eyes, he learned how (not) to act in that case.
Today I want to write about my job.
I am a forensic biologist and I deeply love my job.
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects.
It is dynamic, stimulating and, even if it is not well remunerated, I feel satisfied.
In the last few years, forensic biology has developed many aspects, such as better sensibility, robustness of results, and less time required for analyzing a sample, but what struck me most is how fast this change happens.
Television seems to be a controversial tool.
Does television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way?
From my experience, I believe television covers both entertaining and educational functions.
It notes how many educational programmes have broadened young children's horizons in the past few years, how quickly an adult can learn different basics from a great number of educational programmes, such as cooking, science and technology.
It also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess.
There are so many foul contents, business advertisements, and fake information on TV that citizens won't be able to tell right from wrong, apart from educational contents.
However, I believe the educational programmes on TV still play a vital role in educating both adults and young children.
I think the best restaurant we can go to is " the sailor 's restaurant ".
Here we can eat typical Italian food.
The last time I was here I ate the best pizza I have ever eaten in my life.
The atmosphere reminds me of the sea; in fact, the walls are decorated with a lot of shells and the waiters are dressed like sailors. I think that it's a great idea!
Also, it's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same table.
The owner is a very kind person and I'm sure he will give us a good price.
No future for public transport?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travel, so it has a future.
Currently, most people are used to using their own car to get to work or to go shopping, due to it being more comfortable.
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to climate change.
So, if people were aware of this subject, they wouldn't use their own car so much.
In addition, having a car is very expensive.
First of all, you need to be able to afford to buy it. After that, you must pay for the assurance, council tax, and mechanic bills, and so on.
Whereas in public transport you only have to pay the ticket, you don't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use breaks down it isn't your responsibility.
Besides, public transport pollutes less than cars.
In conclusion, I think public transport has a future, and the more people use it, the more future it will have.
I am your employee, to serve your company.
I am very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment.
But pay a little low.
I completed many tasks, including tutoring three students to complete summer homework, correcting homework diligently to assist the instructor, helping the instructor organize handouts, instead of the instructor answering questions raised by the students, but also cleaning the classroom for hygiene, very hard, but I have nothing to complain about.
I work hard for two months and pay a lot.
Just your wage being paid too much lower than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yuan more than the existing wage basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal.
I think that the government should help improve public transport, for example buses, trains, metros, and so on, for the sole purpose of improving quality of life against pollution.
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations, but it could be annoying to search for parking and the cost of fuel, and also maintenance costs.
In big cities public transport works well because there is a good feedback by people.
Instead, it can't be good in the same way in small cities, because it's not convenient for transport companies to invest money, because fewer people would use it.
Tom Sawyer was a boy who lived with his aunt Polly and she had to punish Tom because sometimes Tom didn't go to school.
On Monday Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Huck which they talk a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his tooth.
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky so Tom talked to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Becky.
Tom said to her about another girl so she got mad and she ignored Tom.
Tom was so sad because Becky didn't talk with him so Tom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks.
When Tom saw his house, he snuck into his house and saw his aunt Polly crying for him.
So the next day the people of the town went to church to hear the funeral of Tom because many people thought that Tom was dead but suddenly Tom opened the door and got in so everybody was so surprised to see Tom.
The next day Huck went to Tom's house to tell him that there is an abandoned house up the hill so the two boys considered it like an adventure.
So they went to the mysterious house and when they were inside they heard voices, so Tom and Huck hid and they saw that Injun Joe was the one that was talking.
The two boys heard that he was planning to steal some money and kill people, so the boys start their adventure on stopping Injun Joe ...
Hi, Jo.
Thank you for your message.
I will do my best to answer your questions.
As for your questions, I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant, such as a Japanese "ryotei" or "izakaya."
That is because you will improve your Japanese skills in them.
Recently, many south east Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working there.
By improving their Japanese skills, they have the opportunity to get a job in Japan.
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.
He was at Sarah's house when suddenly he left all the bathroom dirty and went to his house.
So he went back to Sarah's house and cleaned the bathroom, but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this, so before Michael entered the bathroom, she said: "I know what you left there." And Michael went running to the bathroom.
Hi, Julie.
My school is located in the center of the city in Bangalore, India.
My school has a unique reputation for its friendliness and the quality of education.
I like my maths teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand.
Good morning!
This is an essay about my favourite sport, swimming. I have enjoyed it since I was a child because I can do it alone. I never refuse to go to the swimming pool, especially in summer.
I don't have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar team sports, and always I go alone it isn't boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven't wait anybody.
I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spent a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hair, I hated that!
Luckily, the operation was fine and she left to come with me. And since that day, I go for my own.
I find swimming to be a relaxing exercise, and normally there aren't many people in the pool. However, sometimes there are children and I don't like that so much because they tend to disturb me. But sometimes it is amusing too.
I would recommend to people who do not know how to swim to learn, because I am pretty sure that they will like it and later they can stop swimming.
I think that dance is a way of self-expression.
It's not just a hobby, it's more than that.
Dance is a passion, a way of life.
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupid companions that they do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for discussion.
When you dance, sing, or act, you are showing something to the public, something that's important to you.
If dance is your passion, you practise every day, and you'll keep practising all the days until you can.
If you are tired it doesn't matter, because you like what you're doing.
You 'll wake up early for going to dance , or do dance classes .
It doesn't matter if you go to sleep late, or don't sleep ...
That's a joke. You must sleep.
If you love to dance , you 'll understand me .
Members of my family.
I love my family, especially my little sister. She is sixteen years old and I consider her my best friend because I used to tell her everything about my life.
I have a dog. Its name is Chente, and it is a golden retriever.
It's a loyal dog, he knows how I feel.
My oldest sister, her name is Cinthya, she is really weird with me.
our relation is not good because she is so different from me.
Also, I have a brother. His name is Jose Luis. He is twenty years old. His personality is dynamic and funny.
My mom and my dad, they are good guys.
Actually, I prefer to spend my time alone. I am working in another town so I stay away from my family.
Hi, Mrs.
Kate Ashby,
How are you? I hope you are well.
Of course, for work in our cafe you have to speak English. Maybe you should also know how to cook some type of sweet food like cupcakes, cake, cookies, or brownies. These are the most popular foods this year.
Another thing that you must know is how to deal with people. We are searching for someone who can impress everyone and also someone who can provide good customer service.
We need someone ready to work long hours, because our cafe is going to open every day.
That's all. See you soon.
kisses.
Fer is a great person.
we think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be disappearing, after that we will be having wars.
In 30 years, our anatomy will have changed, we will be eating fast food, and the north pole will have melted totally.
The temperature will have become crazy because of global warming, so some people will have died because the natural disasters will be more aggressive.
The technology will have advanced, and maybe the cars will be flying by streets and computers will have totally changed.
Because of this, we have to raise awareness of what is happening and help the planet.
Friendship is something very important to me.
I can't imagine my life without friends.
How do you make friends and meet new people?
It is easier than you think.
Just start talking!
The most important point in making friends is communication.
You have to remember that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing.
They just have to talk about it calmly.
If your friendship is real, you will always find a point between your opinion and your friend's one.
Just try it, it won't cost you much!
Good day!
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport, Volleyball. It is one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise it 3 times a week since 1980. The reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows:
1- make me fit and healthy
2- classy game with no friction between players
It exercises all muscles of your body.
I advise all rookies to start practising this sport as they will get many benefits.
However, the adults can practise it as well and they will get the same.
As citizens of the village, we totally care about the environment of our village.
Every Sunday, we do a mutual cooperation where anyone can treat rubbish as well as they treat themselves.
We clean the dirty ditch, sweep rubbish, then bury rubbish.
Whilst we are recycling inorganic rubbish too.
From inorganic materials, we can make bags, hats, and other stuff.
Then they can sell them and get income from it.
The creator of the haven and the earth, the creator of soles, the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun.
What we Muslims believe is that we were created by One who has no other with him, the One who created our father Adam and from him Eve. They were in Paradise and instructed not to eat from the tree, but the Satan deceived them and they were brought to this life. Generations came from them and the prophet and messengers were sent (Moses, Jesus, Mohamed, others.. who they worship the same One) with miracles and evidence of the truth, to guide people to know who will follow the truth and be guided to Paradise, and who will follow other paths and be led to hell. So we are here to test in this short life.
Transportation is the heart of any city, whether it is public or private.
Nowadays people prefer their own vehicles rather than
Public transportation is used less and less each day as people become more obsessed with owning their own vehicles, leading to a dark future for public transportation.
I agree with the given statement that there would be tough times for public transportation in the near future. This is because people want privacy as well as freedom, which is quite impossible to find in public transportation.
Secondly, these modes of transportation cover
As much as possible, city areas or towns that mismanage routine travel by public transportation generally cause people to avoid using public transportation. Finally, I can say that there are various modes of transportation available.
to compete with public transportation.
Nowadays, people have numerous options for travelling, like many private companies.
which play an important role in giving tough competition to government . As a result of this, consumers get more benefits like lower fares , privacy , freedom and safe travelling. In addition, many automobile companies are launching new cars with affordable prices which insiost people to use more and more private vechiles .
I go for a walk to the park every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs.
I met many people in the park.
I never thought about how people got so many pets.
The park is very busy even though it is huge!
Some people are very friendly, just like their dog.
But some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs.
The family is the most important institution of social life.
Every member has his own role and the boss, the father or the mother, has to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life.
Usually, there are generation problems, sons don't understand parents and vice versa, but by dialoging and listening to emotions and facts, everyone can have another point of view.
Parents must give rules to sons to underline limits in social behaviour but also must listen to others point of views to rearrange and update his knowledge.
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust, if someone contributes to family duties.
Recently I saw the thriller of mokingjay part 2.
If you want to see that movie, you need to watch the first 3 movies before you understand it.
The first movies were amazing!
A lot of action, drama, and romance.
The fans of this series had been wanting for this movie since the first movie appeared in 2012.
I don't think that this movie is for all the family, because it is hard for little kids to understand. In my opinion I think it is more a teen movie.
I think people will like this movie because it's very similar to the story of the book. This is one of the first movies that is really based on the book. The theme is very unique and original. Also, the actors in the first movie were perfect, and I think that in the last movie, they will put in double the effort.
I hope you guys choose this movie!
It will be very cool to see the last part of Mockingjay!
My favourite sport is karate.
First of all, I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours.
When I have had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate, because it is the kind of sport that is not very hard.
Training karate is a way to forget your problems and to forget your tiring routine.
In my opinion, it's very difficult to find this advantage with other sports.
Apart from that, karate is not just a sport, but also a discipline. It teaches you respect, balance, and even culture.
My teacher showed us how we have to behave with others and he taught us a lot of things about the Japanese culture.
For someone who starts karate, it is easy to follow the class, so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing.
Technology is something that is very important, something without which we cannot live.
Today's topic is Technology.
Nowadays we use technology in everything, from education to making clothes. We use technology everyday and everywhere.
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful, useful and important for development but today's generation is influenced with technology that they have stopped to do other activities.
Last year, my friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition. He liked the idea so he decided to enter the competition.
but there was a fee in order to join the competition, he had no money. Fortunately he had a lot of friends who could lend him.
he phoned me and asked me to lend him some money to register for the competition.
He took the money the second day, finished the registration, and started writing the story after spending a long time writing. He did a good job and went to give his story to the international student magazine office. He found out there was a notice on the door saying that the competition had been canceled. He came back very sad and told me what happened. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.
Travelling by car is not so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable, but actually we do not think about the contamination in our planet.
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I can't sit down because there aren't any chairs for me.
On the other hand, in the future maybe there would be a bus which has chairs for everybody and I don't have to stand up.
Other transport options like taxis are more comfortable, but they are also more expensive than buses or trains.
The AVE or airplane are good options for long trips.
In conclusion, in the future we should have a more comfortable bus.
Nika is 19.
May 5 The date should be written with the month first and then the day.
Dear Sir Dimara.
I am writing about a problem in my city.
I live in Patras, a big city in Greece.
In my city, all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing.
The vandalism in Patras has increased a lot.
Unfortunately, when we tell somebody not to draw on the walls, they don't listen to us.
For our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Patras they see that.
Patras is a very beautiful city for her culture and for her monuments.
Why see that abasing thing?
After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain it.
In my opinion the police should stop the Vandalism.
If there are police all around the city nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to write something or to draw.
I hope you will do something about that problem.
Yours faithfully,
Jessyka Stavros.
Pupils all around the world are waiting for school to finish.
They are eager to begin a new life as adults.
But when they reach in - between periods , confused feelings cross their minds .
As a rule, after last exams, they don't know what university to choose.
What they will do in future they see, like in a fog.
In this way, the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable.
Firstly, it will allow young people to have a rest after the first hard-work studying period.
Ten or eleven years at school make them tired, in spite of the fact that pupils don't notice it.
But choosing the second education is a very important step, which needs a serious attitude.
Secondly, such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in new professional spheres.
Also, they would have an opportunity to be involved in volunteer activity.
And thirdly, they might work for earning their own money or travel.
This year's holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new power for future education.
One year is not a long period.
But the benefits of taking a year off will be obvious.
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan, a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico. The care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of this.
People collect the trash from their houses and wait for the trash truck to take it to a landfill located outside the village.
Also, people go out to collect the trash that there is on the kiosk, the church, or in the principal places on the village.
Dear Sir,
I am interested in improving my English, so I am writing to request further information about the English course.
Firstly, I would like to know how long the course lasts, and if it is possible to get the exact date, because I need to book my flights.
Secondly, I don't live in Cork, so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer in this course.
And also, can you give me an idea of how much it would cost for each different option?
It would be useful if I could live with other students, because it is a good way to learn a language as well.
Lastly, let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully,
Rosa.
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately after listening to conversations of his new neighbours.
They are planning to rob a very precious thing from the Museum tonight.
He doesn't have much time to prove their plan and he couldn't wait to let it happen.
It is his town and it is his duty to save the town's history.
He called the police and informed them about his neighbours robbery plan.
The police reached the museum and caught the robbers red-handed.
I believe that there is no future for public transportation. Using trains is more convenient and less expensive, and it would also decrease the amount of carbon gases which are affecting the ozone. People should be aware about the effect of using public transportation on the economy and environment. Governments should encourage people to use other ways for transportation. This subject should be discussed in all media outlets to educate and encourage people to use the right method of transportation.
Hello, Estela!
How are you? I hope you are well.
I'm writing to tell you about my last summer holiday.
I went to Las Hurdes.
I stayed about one week in the home of my boyfriend.
I was in a wedding.
While I was there, I did a lot of things.
One day, I visited Meandro del Melero.
It was beautiful.
And the view was wonderful.
The other day, I walked a lot and at the end of the way, we found a waterfall.
The waterfall's name was Chorrituelo.
It was spectacular!
I had a great time on the wedding day and slept very late.
The wedding was in the morning, and in the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people.
However, we had dinner in a garage at night and there was a party all night.
You should visit Las Hurdes. It is a beautiful site.
And there are a lot of things.
And the people are very nice.
English is an international language that becomes important for the modern world.
In China, English is taken to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn.
They begin to study English at an early age.
They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge every day .
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words.
That's a good phenomenon, for English is essential nowadays.
In addition to , some people think English is superior to Chinese .
In my opinion, though English is of great significance, English is after all a foreign language.
It is hard for people to see eye to eye.
English helps us read English original works, but Chinese helps us learn the true China.
Only Chinese literature can send off its brilliance.
The first step to learning a country's culture, especially its classic culture, is to learn its language.
Because we are Chinese, why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture through a foreign language?
I was in a fantastic restaurant, Woolypools, last month.
It is small but comfortable and famous for its big burgers.
Woolypools is a speciallist in meal , it 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion, the restaurant can be better with respect to meat, but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends.
I expect to be more famous, better, and bigger.
The problem of the restaurant is the place, it is far from the people and cities, and the space, that is very small for lots of people.
In this life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on.
For example, a present or a gift, especially if it's from your best friend.
Once, I got sick and stayed at the general hospital, and my friend gave me a flower.
It was my favorite flower I have ever seen.
In my town we create a small organization for a more healthy environment, beauty touch and to be attractive. The citizens in the town must participate in this. The citizen will take the responsibility for a specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into the correct place and clean tree and plant more of it.
I agree with the opinion that the famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.
It's horrible to have a person behind you all the time, you don't have a life, no peace, no happiness.
In addition, all persons have the right to privacy and to be free.
Nevertheless, the journalists stay all the time having a photo, all the time, when they eaten, drinking, happy, sad, how is your love life and with whoever stay, if stay with something important our what buy.
This is terrible, you do not have enough privacy, the society is to blame, because if they did not take photos of the lives of famous people, our lives would be boring.
So that politicians and film stars will have support, because then they will have to bear it, because they then have the reward with what they earn.
This is all I have.
Good morning.
How are you?
Come here.
Get down from there.
Get into the room.
Get on the bus.
Let's walk.
Let's play cards.
Let us sleep.
Please let me in.
Let me go.
Let me see your photos.
Let me watch your house.
Let me enter your cabin.
Forgive me.
Bring that toy here.
Bring a glass of water.
Drink more water.
Eat the food.
Run quickly.
Stop shouting. Don't shout.
Let us bathe.
Once upon a time there was a little ant called Penny. He was really small compared to the others.
He hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happened.
It was a dark night and it was raining until a big active volcano explosion buried them into the underground.
All of them tried to find a way out, but no one could find one. They started to get panicked!
People just started to evacuate rapidly until a big earthquake began.
Penny was too sad, the only thing he could do was to wait and keep calm.
They all go out until dawn, so they are sacred until they find a refuge.
Everyone wanted to witness the queen, but no one found anything.
Like they were very religious ants they prey for her sacred ancestors so they can help them in the big deal.
Something that they don't know was that the whole thing was a movie!
So everything was planned ...
The actors had monitors that watched the ants all the time.
One day Penny discovered it and went to tell it to his queen. The queen, at knowing that she got very confused but at the same time got mad and wanted revenge.
So they make a plan to display all of their...
The next day when they were about to start filming, there were no ants there so they searched for them, but they couldn't find them...
In that moment the ants and Penny attack them from behind, making them leave the place.
The ants win the war and expand their habitat to the studio.
No one attacks them again and they live happily ever after!
I have many favorite sports.
I'm particularly keen on playing basketball. I always spend more time playing it.
I usually play basketball for at least thirty minutes every day.
After a hard day at University I go home and then I go to the stadium to play.
One thing that makes sure I finish all my work before I play my favorite sport is having a plan.
Basketball has many benefits not only to me but also to everyone.
It makes me feel relaxed and unwound.
Besides, it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape.
I really crave I really crave chocolate when I'm stressed.
She's about playing it .
When I have spare time, I often gather my friends to watch a basketball match on television.
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning.
Sometimes, I play it near the sports centre.
I go back home and have a deep sleep when I finish it.
Basketball is an outdoor activity.
That is the reason why basketball is my favorite sport.
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population , many agricultueal land , forests and ocesns had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks .
From my own perspective, I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment, or even human and animals.
To start with, there are a wide range of troubles that may be leading to this phenomenon.
Convincing arguments can be made that the root cause of the housing crisis is that almost all present-day cities are already packed with places of residence, commerce, and recreation, and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce.
Additionally, people now continue to destroy more agricultures and forests in order to satisfy all their needs, which will destroy the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity, especially the endangered species.
According to the problems mentioned above, various approaches that government should adopt to deal with this problem. First of all, reducing building constructure from now on, planting more trees instead.
Sustainable development should be awareness to all human and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals.
To sum up, this unpleasant phenomenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before things get worse and the governments have to take the responsibility for that.
Nowadays languages are very important, especially English.
This is not the first time I study English.
I have been studying English since I was a child and I never spoke and learned so well since I decided to go to London for one course to learn this language.
I took that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted, so when I heard about that opportunity I said yes.
The car is not the best way for transport, because it produces much pollution, however the public transport is better to do a journey.
It can carry many people without any problems.
Nowadays in the developed cities there are many possibilities for public transport, like bus, train, subway, tram etc. These options are more economical than the car. The problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied by one person, when the car is prepared to carry four or five people.
This situation creates a lot of pollution for the environment, so we should be more conscience about the planet's health.
I want to say something about learning English. It is hard for me for the following reasons:
The first reason is that the grammar that the learners, teachers, or institutes teach is like the Spanish language, my native language.
It is very difficult to understand the conjunction of the verb 's in the Spanish language, just imagine you the same but not in your native language.
The second reason is that, in English syntax, the structure for constructing paragraphs or sentences, the verb is usually written before the subject, but not always. Which is the rule?
Is there anyone here?
The third reason is:
I love playing cricket.
I am enthusiastic about this game.
My favourite team is India because I belong to this country.
In India , 85 percent of people follow cricket .
In 1993, the Indian cricket team won its first world cup and that changed the direction of the wind in favour of cricket and everyone started to follow this game.
I love this game because my favourite sportsman belongs to this game.
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, known as little master.
Whenever I play this game, I always follow this person's lead.
His stance, style, shots, running between the wickets, everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark.
Not only I but also every Indian always follows Sachin for cricket.
When he was 18, he played his first game for India.
He is the first player to play 200 tests in cricket.
He has many achievements like first 200 in one day etc.
I love the way he played.
First, they have to decide what they can do better, batting or bowling.
If the person wants to become a bowler, they should concentrate on running, action, and stance. For batsmen, they need to concentrate on lag and bat coordination, eye and bat coordination, and discover some shots which become key factors in batting.
Also watch videos of some of the best players like Sachin, Rahul, Sir Don Bradman, Hayden, Wasim Akram, Brett Lee, etc.
As health is an important factor in every sport, so also is the need to improve health and stamina.
Dear Jo,
I'm glad to hear you are going to visit my country.
I am looking forward to this.
I can give you advice on traveling and working in my country.
I wish you will have an impressive time.
The weather is neither hot nor cold all year , you needn't bring too many clothes because you can buy them here .
If you want to travel this city, I can be your guide as I have a year free before university too.
This is a modern city.
People usually came here for shopping or eating.
There are many local foods that are very popular.
You might like this.
I also want to introduce my friends to you. We can have fun together.
When you have played enough in this city and you want to find a job here, you will need to know where to look.
I can recommend you to my uncle's company to do a job.
It is difficult to get a job here if you are foreign and haven't finished college.
It may take a very long time to find a job and you don't have much time here.
You may consider my advice.
My favorite sport is swimming.
It's because swimming is really fun.
Also, I think swimming can keep our bodies fit and it can make the people who swim feel cool when it is a hot day.
The advice that I give to someone who wants to start swimming.
It is not be afraid of water, otherwise they may not learn swim and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little.
This is the advice that I give to them.
Dear Camp Director,
My name is Eider and I am 21 years old. I read your advertisement in the newspaper!
And I am really sure that I am the person that you are looking for.
I am a monitor in my free time, and I am looking for a temporary job to improve my English.
I have no problems working in a kitchen, as my parents have a bar.
According to my age, evening activities are not a problem for me, and I played many sports during my life, such as soccer, volleyball, ...
I am waiting for your answer, Eider.
I live in a small village.
All residents take great care of the environment.
Organized shares, where everyone cleans up the village.
All residents segregate garbage thrown into suitable containers.
Thus helping to protect our environment to make it clean and safe, in order to not jeopardize our various diseases.
In my village there are trash cans so that no one throws debris on the ground.
There are special places where you can organize bonfires, but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage.
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources, because a wind power plant is close by.
Recently, batteries were also set on the roof of the primary school, and the whole school uses solar energy instead of electricity.
They organize monthly meetings on the environment, and residents participate in them.
All residents of my village try to pollute the environment as little as possible so that our village is clean.
There are several reasons to consider travelling in your own car instead of taking public transportation. First, you can control your own environment and choose your own music, temperature, and so on. Second, you can travel at your own pace and make stops when and where you want. Third, you can avoid the crowds and the hassle of public transportation.
Firstly, the bus always drops by to pick up a passenger that takes more time than expected to time of travel.
Secondly, the public vehicle route is more far than the usual route.
Thirdly, it is also crowded and there is no privacy.
Finally, there is a chance to become a victim of theft or a pocket picker.
However, public transportation is much cheaper than buying a new car and for the adventurer who wants to have an exciting travel, then they can see more action.
Like watching outside or sightseeing, to mingle and meet different people.
In addition to this, I also admire the bullet train in Japan which you consider fast and safe public vehicle.
To sum it up, I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convenient.
Public transportation will have a future unless they have a project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passengers.
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision to extract minerals .
More details and reasons to support my opinion will be elaborated in the following paragraphs.
To begin with, extracting the mineral will be harmful to our environment.
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown.
I spent every summer of my childhood there.
However, it will probably disappear if the developing equipment is set.
Next to go will be the extraction of the valuable mineral, which will definitely lead to air pollution.
There has been an example of the other town being polluted by the process of developing the mineral .
No one can deny that preventing pollution is one of the utmost important things.
Last but not least, the mineral extraction will have a profound influence, especially on our offspring.
To take my friend Taylor as an example, her homeland was over-developed and became an arid place when she was a child.
After she grows up, she decides to leave her hometown and never go back.
In addition, she has no happy memories of her childhood.
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us.
Due to the mineral development, many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before.
It seems like a sought-after chance.
Nevertheless, they do not give us any promise of the vacancy.
In addition, money is not as important when it comes to health and environmental conservation.
In a nutshell, the disadvantages of extracting the valuable mineral outweigh the advantages.
Therefore, I do not agree with this decision.
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearance of pollution.
The burning of fossil fuels by vehicles is a major cause of global warming.
Global warming is a serious issue. Higher temperatures make the ice caps melt.
The longer we bury our heads in sand, the warmer the Earth will be.
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences!
I don't believe in it, especially while cars are not flying.
Even if it happens, there are many people who can't get a car because it is too expensive, not only for buying but for fuel, service and so forth.
Buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket.
And what about trains?
I saw a tv show about trains in Japan - that is the future of public transport.
I want to see a blue sky, not a stream of cars like in the film "The Fifth Element."

Dear Mr. Carlos

We hope you keep preferring us.
Yours sincerely.

My name is Chew.
I'm 25 years old and I come from Malaysia. I'm an energetic, cheerful, hardworking and considerate person.
I have 3 siblings in my family who I take care of all the time when our parents are busy with their work.
During my school, I like to play volleyball and I'm an excellent player.
We used to organise competitions and tournaments with other schools.
This is my favourite sport.
During my leisure time, I like to help my parents in the kitchen.
We cook a variety of food and dishes.
I enjoy dirty and oily hands in the kitchen.
With reference to the above, I would like to apply for the Summer Camp job with my full commitment.
Contemporary Art is a very controversial issue nowadays.
There are many sources, creators, and themes.
It is well known that many Art curators and Artists believe that Contemporary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based on their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the times this is unintelligible .
Luckily, the most expensive art is still the old art, like Picasso or Freud.
Nowadays, a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at auctions around the world for extraordinary high prices.
Experimental art has taken the art world by surprise.
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would not be possible to stop.
So now we have many choices and an infinity of information available to us at any given time.
With this stated, we now have an idea of how artists create.
The sports days were held on Kwai Chung Sports Ground on 12th and 13th November.
The weather was partly cloudy.
I got there by taking the MTR.
I arrived at the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I 've joined the 100-metre race .
On the first day, before the sports day begins, we have the opening ceremony.
The athletic representative passed the torch and we sang the anthem.
After that, the sports day began formally.
The girl's grade C 100-metre race started at 10:45 a.m.
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal's.
The teacher called my name twice and told me to stand in a different place.
So I know that there was someone whose name was pronounced the same as mine.
Near the race, I was very nervous.
When I was running, I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing by my face.
That feel was very comfortable and made me feel relaxed.
I was tenth out of 27 people.
Although it is not a great result, I have already tried my best.
At the end of the day, our school announced the marks the four houses have got.
My house got number two temporarily.
I felt hopeful that my house would get the champion.
On the second day, my classmates called me to take part in the Inter-class relay race.
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running.
Finally, our class got the first prize.
We have a 0.5 second difference in the first race.
I implicated my class from winning the championship.
At last, my house got the second runner-up.
I hope my house will be the champion in the next year.
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
I do not believe this statement is accurate.
We should use public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harming the environment and the world.
It is the best that all people go to the place walking or running on the other hand it is more healthy.
There is nothing wrong with going to the place in a car, obviously, it is faster than a bus and cheaper but not always.
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport.
It is commonly debated that tourism has greatly influenced not only the aspects of one country but of the whole world.
Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives, it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorant.
First of all, tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world.
Alongside its development, the ability to travel has eased to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another.
The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism as well as with the idea of globalization, since a traveler is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen.
Secondly, tourism, especially in developed countries, has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view.
There are countries, such as Greece or Bulgaria, in which the economy relies merely on tourism.
If tourism influences the economy, it thereby influences the environment, and if it influences the environment it influences the transport. How? People become more careful at their historical sites, this way preserving them; Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale:
At a small scale, in cities, in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficiently.
At a large scale, people can now travel in almost any possible way: on land, on sea, or in the air.
Cruises and train vacations were born through the development of tourism.
Once upon a time, there was a tiger who lived in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her three daughters.
The tiger, named Amanda, was 25 years old when the herders killed her parents. The herders were poor and didn't have enough food to survive, so they killed the tigers.
The tiger's boyfriend was a lion named John who was 27 years old. His dad died because he got an infection from a conflict with other animals.
Her mom died because something or someone dragged her by the leg and dropped her in a cave where other animals ate her.
They died when John was too little to remember and he never knew what happened so he went to all the parts and saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them .
The 3 daughters were so different from each other.
The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah. She is 9 years old and loves to run. She is the fastest of the family and has a lot of spots.
She is one of the people who tend to make something enforcing.
The second daughter, Elizabeth, is the most intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters.
I was 12 years old.
Another animal gives them rewards or bonus because she discovers that water is liquid.
The last daughter, Ana, who was the youngest of the family, is a jaguar.
She stays in bed and does nothing all day.
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never worked.
One of the animals went with Ana and gave her an incentive for being an athlete or made something else besides staying asleep.
The end.
Hello, friend.
I know you are searching for a flat to live in for the whole next year.
Maybe I found something for you: when I was on the bus returning home I read a journal with some advertisements.
There is a nice flat near my home: it is perfect for someone who wants to live there for only a year.
There is a little kitchen, a great bedroom, a bathroom with shower but without bath and a cool living-room.
I think that you have to bring winter clothes with you because here the weather is really cold!
Write to me soon.
Alessia is a great singer.
Hello Riley, about the question you made me in your letter, it has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both.
Last night I made a decision.
I think that you should give up your music classes.
You have been taking classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano, so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free time you could still play piano without going to the classes.
This is my opinion but the decision is yours, so when you decide it please send me a letter telling me about it.
I love you, Ines.
Hey my name is Joe and I'm 21 years old and I think I would compliment the summer camp very well, because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak.
My current job is to be a nurse at the local hospital and I can do everything a doctor can.
So if the kids are going to hurt themselves, then I'll can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and smaller injuries.
The most exciting day of my life was June 3rd, last year.
I had an exam.
I woke up early that day because I was nervous.
Then I revise Maths at home, before going to school, as at school, before beginning the exam.
When I started to read the tracks I became agitated and I thought that I wasn't able to finish and pass that test.
But when I finished before the time, I was happy and relaxed.
I always said that I passed that test and I was sure of it.
This is true.
I passed that test!
Hello, Charlie.
I really enjoyed hearing from you.
Congratulations to your sister for your prize.
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition, although in my city there aren't a lot of competitions of this kind. If I had a possibility of going, I'd already spend the tickets.
My favourite sport is basketball.
When I was three years old, my parents took me skiing.
At the beginning I went to the kindergarten and they taught me skiing.
It was a lot of fun, because I could not do it.
At noon, my parents took me with them and we drove together.
My father took me between his knees, because I could drive without falling and it was fun.
When I was older, my dream was to "snowboard," but I should learn to ski perfectly like my parents.
Later when I was 16 years old, my dream came true.
I had my first snowboarding lesson and I loved it.
I took every free minute to drive my snowboard.
That was the story of why I go snowboarding.
I enjoy snowboarding because you feel free when you are driving down the piste.
You are like a bird.
It is the best feeling in the world.
You are very happy and sometimes I sing a song and the world is perfect.
That is everything I want to have and I'm lucky.
That's why I like winter more than summer.
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who wants to come to other thoughts.
Although you are all the time in nature, you can see animals only when you are lucky.
It had been a very long and tiring day, but Tom felt he had achieved something great.
Yesterday, he was on his way home and it was getting dark.
his parents were worried and called him a couple of times.
He started to walk very quickly.
Everything was dark.
She opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky.
A dark sky without stars.
She got up and looked around.
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax.
Although she couldn't remember how she arrived there, she started to take consciousness.
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from her house to this place.
The problem is the last thing she remembers is that she has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind.
She fell asleep again, didn't she?
If she did, how did she manage to walk until there in her sleep?
If she wasn't awake, why couldn't she remember anything after that?
This situation was really frustrating, not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep.
She started to walk to clear her mind.
She knows her way even in the dark; she had gone to this spot a lot of times, especially the last few weeks.
The development of human technology is seen everywhere.
In the case of transportation technology, in this twenty-first century we have various options like planes that can fly with the clouds, trains that are fast and big enough to carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour, and boats that are much bigger and faster than ancient times.
Although compared to ancient times we are lucky enough to have all these options.
However, if I have the option to choose between all three, I will say the plane.
There are three reasons to choose this.
The first reason is its speed. Compared to both other means of transportation, it can travel faster.
It can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours.
As a result, people can save their time.
Second is safety, compared to other the chances of accident is less.
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than by train or boat.
The third one is the comfort level.
Plan is much more comfortable than both train and boat.
In conclusion, I will say that the plane will be my first choice of the three means of transportation.
The reason behind my choice is speed, safety and comfort level that make plan as my first choice.
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university, to earn money or travel. It would be the best award for a student who attended the high school.
The young people want to discover the world by travelling to places which would be unreachable otherwise.
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was at the beach all the afternoon.
I went with my parents and my sister.
The beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño.
There are a lot of people on the beach.
The water was very cold and I couldn't swim, so I played football in the sand on the beach.
I took the sun for a very long time and then I went to a cafe and drank a refreshment.
I had a good time with my family, so it was a nice day.
No future for public transport? Is this a claim or not?
Will we see public transport on our roads in 5 or even 10 years? That is a really interesting question.
I think it all depends on the development.
now we can see that more and more people prefer to travel by car.
Yes, I agree. If you plan to travel a long distance and for a long time, you would prefer to do it by car because you'll spend less time travelling, it will be more comfortable, and you'll have the opportunity to stop wherever and for however long you need.
But if we are talking about travelling across your city, would you prefer public transport or a car?
I think that this is a question for everyone, and the answer can't be one for all, because someone can use public transport and economy by this not only money, but and the environment, but some people don't like to use p.t., because they spend more time for travelling or they simple don't like to travel with another people.
In my opinion, even after 10 years, the public transport will be crossing our street with enough amount of passengers.
Hello, Lara.
Thank you for your email.
My name is Mohamed and I am a 28-year-old male from the kingdom of Bahrain.
I go to the gym and run on a daily basis to keep in shape and stay healthy.
I look forward to knowing more about you.
I am trying to keep my village's environment non-polluted and viable for life.
In order to attain this goal, I have to take steps and actions to protect the environment as follows:
No smoking in public places.
Increasing the number of tries and plants and punishing the person who cuts them.
Establishing the factories outside of the village.
protect the water sources and the sea.
Guide the people and give them information, details, and guidelines about pollution.
I would like to tell you about my favorite restaurant, Lemon. I go there every week and it has different food from any other restaurant. I like chicken crispy with garlic sauce. It's an excellent choice for me. My favorite appetizer is sausage and for dessert I would rather have "Vadge" cake with chocolate sauce. I feel at ease when I go there and enjoy classical music over lunch. The service is very good and all staff are respectable. I can't imagine one week without going there. That drives me nuts. I advise anyone to go there and enjoy their time. This restaurant also has a relative advantage in hygiene, which is excellent. Despite all of these advantages, prices are not expensive.
Volleyball is one of the most difficult sports in the world. You should put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side in the game.
I have been practicing volleyball for twelve years and because of it I knew a lot of people who help me to grow up in the sport and life.
When I was 10, I was chosen to play with a group of girls older than me. They were good, and I can't believe the experience.
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I am in another world, in which I can be free and happy. Apart from this, when I am bad, this is a distraction from the university.
You should try practicing, it's so funny, but I advertise to you, it's not easy at first, but you have to try many times like you should do in life.
On weekdays, I get off my bed at 7 in the morning to go to my work which starts at 9 AM.
I often go to sleep around midnight.
I usually play video games if I do not have any homework to do.
I am not a big fan of sports so I do not play any sports.
However, I sometimes skip to fit myself.
Michael wakes up in the morning and reads the newspaper.
He read an interesting notice in the newspaper.
The notice was about a competition.
The competition is about writing stories.
Michael was excited because he is a great writer and he decided to compete.
First, he found an idea for the story and decided to make it about pirates looking for treasure.
He began to write.
The story was very good but Michael did not know how to end the story.
Finally, Michael ended the story and went to the post office.
Michael sent the story but knew at that moment he had made a mistake; he didn't put his name and address on it.
Yes, I think TV can entertain and educate, because there are many comedies.
There are also a lot of educational channels.
I think historical channels are very interesting, because you can learn new things about the past.
Comedies are so funny, so when you are sad you can watch one of them.
There are many discussions about the future of public transport.
Different experts have talked about this question and there are so many opinions.
Some people usually prefer to use their cars because they like to have the freedom for moving comfortably.
Public transport is usually restricted by timetables and you can only use the transport at the moment that the timetable lets you.
Many people don't like to use public transport because they want to move themselves when they need.
On the other hand, public transport is better for the environment, because the pollution is less than using your own car.
In the future, people's commodity may determine the most use of cars rather than public transport.
Susan is a little girl.
Her skin is colored red and green, red dots on top of the green to be more precise.
She does that every day after school.
Of course, she also has a little brother.
His skin is red, just like his father's.
