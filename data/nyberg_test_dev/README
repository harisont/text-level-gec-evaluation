These are the test and development sets of the SweLL corpus, selected and
processed by Nyberg (2022).

Files with the suffix .orig.txt contain sentences from original student texts,
and the corresponding .corr.txt files contain line-aligned normalized
versions.

The data is divided into three CEFR levels (A, B and C). The following files
are needed to compare to the GLEU evaluation (Nyberg 2022, Section 4.1):

    Nyberg.CEFR_A.test.corr.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_A.test.orig.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_B.test.corr.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_B.test.orig.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_C.test.corr.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_C.test.orig.txt

Subsets of these files have been used in the manual evaluation (Nyberg 2022,
Section 4.2):

    Nyberg.CEFR_A.manual_test.corr.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_A.manual_test.orig.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_B.manual_test.corr.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_B.manual_test.orig.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_C.manual_test.corr.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_C.manual_test.orig.txt

Development set, only available with all levels merged:

    Nyberg.CEFR_ABC.dev.corr.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_ABC.dev.orig.txt

Finally, the following files contain references to the SweLL corpus, in case
further metadata is desired:

    Nyberg.CEFR_ABC.id_test.corr.txt
    Nyberg.CEFR_ABC.id_test.orig.txt
