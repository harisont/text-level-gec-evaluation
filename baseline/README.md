# NMT baseline

The main file here is `corruptor.py`, which can be used to produce artifical
L2-like Swedish, in order to train an NMT system to restore it.

Run `download.sh` followed by `dalaj.py` to generate data files needed.

`extract_sprakbanken.py` and `clean.py` can be used to get large amounts of
cleaned and deduplicated plain text in Swedish. This is run through
`corruptor.py` and the resulting pair of clean/corrupted texts is used to
train an MT system. Note that `clean.py` needs a lexicon file generated by
`get_saldo_vocab.py`.

With OpenNMT, this becomes a rather strong baseline for our experiments.
